# Digit-Recognizer
Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset
This project revolves around a program that will recognize a handwritten digit fed to it - quickly and correcly.

I am trying out several machine learning algorithms and concepts. I will include the description of all the algorithms I choose and the reason out here.
-#SOFTMAX
I started out using softmax in tensorflow. This is a nice algorithm for starters as it gives a fairly good sense of what is to be done and how. Although it gave me an accuracy of 91.8% which is not good, but it was a good start.
